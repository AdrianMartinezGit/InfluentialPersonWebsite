              <p class="font-normal text-base leading-6 text-white">On November 18, 2011, “Notch”  held the first ever 
                Minecon annual convention to celebrate the full
                release of the long-awaited sandbox game which 
                has been in development since 2009, having left his
                job to work on the game. Minecraft would become
                one of the most successful games in the world.
                
                After many years of working and seeing the amount
                of attention the game would receive, Notch would
                transfer control of the project over to his colleague
                and lead designer, Jebs Bergensten, who currently
                serves as the CCO of Mojang Studios.
                
                Notch has since left the project in 2013 to pursue
                other fields. </p>
